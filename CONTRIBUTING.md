# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! A few quick notes to get you started.

## Setup
- Use a Python 3.10+ virtualenv.
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create a `.env` with required keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## Workflow
- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Keep edits focused and small; write clear commit messages.
- Open a PR describing the change, screenshots if UI.

## Code Style
- Prefer clear, descriptive names; avoid one-letter vars.
- Keep functions small; use early returns.
- Add comments only for non-obvious logic.

## Reporting Issues
- Include steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior.
- Attach logs or screenshots when possible.
