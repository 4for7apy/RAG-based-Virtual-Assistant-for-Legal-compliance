Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We believe a new technology paradigm is emerging that manifests itself through an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. There are three characteristics that define this shift.

The first is that the experience layer is becoming multidevice and multisense; where a person’s experience with technology will span a multitude of devices and become increasingly more natural and multisensory with voice, ink, gestures, and gaze interactions. Second, artificial intelligence (AI) will be pervasive across devices, apps, and infrastructure to drive insights and act on your behalf. Third, computing will be more distributed than ever before with computing power at the edge; whether it’s the connected car, the connected factory floor, or any connected device.

ServiceNow was founded in 2004 on a revolutionary idea to transform how work gets done across the enterprise.

Today, enterprises need to evolve faster, but lack of process and legacy tools hold them back. Every day, thousands of customer requests, IT incidents, and HR cases follow their own paths — moving back and forth between people, machines, and departments. Unstructured. Undocumented. Unimproved for years.

With the ServiceNow System of Action™, you can replace these unstructured work patterns of the past with intelligent workflows of the future. Now every employee, customer, and machine can make requests on a single cloud platform. Every department working on these requests can assign, prioritize, collaborate, resolve root cause issues, gain real-time insights, and drive action. Employees are energized, service levels improve, and game-changing economics are realized. That’s Work at Lightspeed™— a smarter, faster way to get work done.

Infosys Enterprise Service Management Café is an AI-powered plug and play solution that provides all the process templates you need and ready-to-deploy code that makes your ServiceNow implementation 40 to 50 percent faster.

It consolidates and rationalizes the tools you already have and helps in predicting service outages, automatically orchestrating remediation, and enabling users to self-serve their needs from the Café app store. With Infosys Enterprise Service Management Café, you can pick from a choice of over 40 super-useful plugins to manage your always-on service delivery landscape. This delivers the productivity savings and efficiencies you need to drive innovation in enterprise service management and continuous service improvement, not just for IT but beyond for other business functions.

The outcomes are significant such as 30 percent improvements in user satisfaction along with 25 percent reduction in efforts.

I’d also like to congratulate Salil Parekh who has guided this transformation and tops the 2024 Brand Guardianship Index, in the category.”

Infosys, recently, onboarded tennis icons Rafael Nadal and Iga Świątek as brand ambassadors, and launched its ‘Champions Evolve’ campaign.

About Us

Infosys media platform capitalizes on current & innovative technologies to facilitate creative collaboration, enable a production on an industrial scale, and monetize customer relationships. The unifying framework integrates the various ecosystems and provides a common platform to deliver services and technology solutions for the media content value chain.

The intelligently woven media and metadata management framework uses smart workflows and incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence to create, manage, moderate content metadata, and orchestrate workflows across different business functions. Additionally, the platform delivers the benefits of productivity, scale, and agility via the cloud and streamlines collaboration between the plethora of partners and technology solutions across the supply chain.

The Platform consists of various modules to serve different business functions.

TheCuration Moduleprovides the master workflow and ingests content from internal archives and multiple sources and includes functions like automated QC, Editing, Review, and Approval, and censor editing.

TheArchive Digitizationmodule uses AI/ML to create a composite index of frame level, time-coded metadata of recognized elements such as celebrities/known personalities, objects, brands, text, and images along with enabling intelligent Ad spot identification.

TheCustom AI modelingcapability ensures that newly introduced elements such as celebrities, brands, etc. can be continuously trained and recognized.

TheLocalization Moduleenables Automatic generation of close captions and subtitles in multiple languages while enabling collaboration across multiple locations and vendors present around the globe.

The Platform’sDigital Distribution Modulehas standard workflow models and a state-of-the-art dashboard to enable global distribution to digital platforms at scale.

Content Enrichment

Leveraging AI models to process video files to generate time coded metadata for post-production and distribution processes. Infosys Media Platform can recognize multiple metadata attributes like celebrities, brands, music, shot changes, text visible on screen and any other objects visible in the video frames. Once the metadata is enriched, this can be used for compliance checks, censor editing or in providing real time metadata driven contextual and dynamic ad-placements.

Infosys Media Platform comes with capability to process the audio (dialogs from a video, lyrics from a song, speech from a podcast) and convert the same into closed captions and subtitles. The platform also has built in capabilities to recognize the language on its own and further translate it on demand into 30+ languages without taking any additional processing time. This will help a content provider to distribute content globally with a significant reduction in time to market.

Using the video content and speech detection capabilities, Infosys Media Platform can recognize presence of mature content (profanity, violence, gore etc.). The information is provided at the shot level which enables a censor editor to easily review and clip content. Alternately the same information can be used by video players to jump content at run time to provide “demography appropriate” viewing experience.

Similar to the capabilities on Video/Music content, Infosys Media Platform has ability to identify various attributes of an image file. A number of image attribute driven actions can be performed using ability to recognize celebrities, brands, emotions, objects and context from a file. A good example could be automated advertising quality review process for publishing ads on an online platform. Or using OCR based text recognition to perform text analytics.

Infosys Media Platform comes with capability to manage end to end supply chain of digital metadata creation, updates, packaging and distribution. Driven by smart workflows, the platform can interface with any systems to collect, compare or update metadata; perform automated quality checks and package it in the format requested by third party content consumers.

Using natural language processing capabilities of the platform, you can review any string of text (dialogs, lyrics, conversations) to determine the context of the conversation as well as the sentiment. This in turn helps in digital content consumption analytics by adding the dimension of sentiment further improving the personalization and recommendation capabilities.
